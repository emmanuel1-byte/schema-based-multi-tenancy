# Multi-Tenancy Practice App with Express.js

This repository contains a simple multi-tenancy practice app built with Express.js and PostgreSQL. The app demonstrates the concept of separating data for different tenants in a multi-tenant architecture.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenant Setup:** Each organization (tenant) has its own schema in the database.
- **Read-Write Operations:** Demonstrates read and write operations for each tenant.
- **Express.js:** Utilizes Express.js for building the RESTful API.
